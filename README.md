Introduction to Pandas

1.
```markdown
Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called `student_data`. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.
The DataFrame should have two columns, `student_id` and `age`, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.
Input:
student_data:
[
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
Output:
+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
